	Lorenz System:

	the

		lorenz system
	</a> 
	was first used to model atmospheric convection or something like that, since then it become a staple of the demonstration of chaos theory<br><br>
	from wikipedia
	<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system">
	The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations first studied by mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz. It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system. In popular media the "butterfly effect" stems from the real-world implications of the Lorenz attractor, i.e. that in any physical system, in the absence of perfect knowledge of the initial conditions (even the minuscule disturbance of the air due to a butterfly flapping its wings), our ability to predict its future course will always fail.
